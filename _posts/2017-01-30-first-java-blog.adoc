Many of us are devoted lovers of the Java Programming language;  
some of us use Java out of necessity, while others use it because it is fun 
and neat to code with. Regardless of your reason to program with Java, there 
is a 90 percent probability (well I just made that up) that you are monitoring 
the status of development of Java 9.

Java One ( as it is popularly coined) has the potential to be of the most exciting 
iterations of the programming language. It brings to the playing field a lot of 
improvements that make coding in java easier and more organized. Among these features 
notably is the Project Jigsaw, the Java Platform's new module system. 
This enables us to modularize our java application and only import libraries 
that we need (just like the ever exciting spring framework). 
With this major introduction to the framework, most codes have to be refactored 
in order to utilize this functionality. 

In addition the new module introduction, features like private interface methods, 
diamond operator for anonymous classes, stack walking, redirected platform logging 
and support for reactive streams have been introduced. To learn about these new 
features, check the blog: https://www.sitepoint.com/ultimate-guide-to-java-9/[The Ultimate Guide to Java 9 by Nicolai Parlog].

Long story short, Java is about to get a lot more exciting 
- just like spring! But in order to harness these exciting features, we need to 
know some cool features that already exist from Java 7 and Java 8. According to 
a https://plumbr.eu/blog/java/java-version-and-vendor-data-analyzed-2016-edition
[Java vendor analysis by  Nikita Salnikov-Tarnovski], it shows that Java 8 and 7 
adoption is little over 45 percent world-wide with Java 6 trailing at the bottom 
with little over 10 percent. This simply means that some developers do not see 
the need to upgrade. In this post, I will be discussing some of the exciting 
and beneficial features that have been introduced since Java 7. 

TIP: Code examples in the following paragraphs can be found in 
https://github.com/geraldoyudo/in-preparation-for-java-9[my github account].


== Secrets of the Java 7
As I was (and still am) daydreaming about getting my hands dirty with the 
java 9, I found a lot of cool features already existent in java 7. 


=== Underscores in Numeric Literals

Who hasnâ€™t grown tired of counting the zeros and digits whenever we declare
a really large numeric value? I know I have, and coming across this feature
made me think to myself "where have you been all my life?". It turns out that, 
just as in writing where we separate digits with commas, you can separate digits 
of your numeric literals with underscores. Nifty huh? Now numeric literals 
can be much more readable. Look at the sample below: 


[[UnderscoresNumericLiterals.java]]
[source, java]
----
public class UnderscoresNumericLiterals {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        long aReallyLargeNumber = 1_234_553_000_000L;
        System.out.println(aReallyLargeNumber);
        
    }
}
----


The resulting output is the same when the underscores are removed. 
The difference is that your code becomes much more easier to read. 


=== Binary Literals

Some applications require modelling data in binary form. 
Extra conversion steps have to be carried out in order to store the data 
models in primitive form. But since the release of java 7, 
you can directly save a numeric literal in binary form. Look at the snippet below:

[[BinaryLiterals.java]]
[source, java]
----
public class BinaryLiterals {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int firstDigit = 0b101;
        int secondDigit = 0xaf;
        System.out.println(String.format("0b101 = %d\n0xaf = %d", firstDigit, secondDigit));
      
    }
}
----


The console output becomes: 

----
0b101 = 5
0xaf = 175
----

Pretty cool right? 


=== Strings in Switching Statements!!!

Oh boy, when I heard I could do this, I was like - "java, you took a weight off
my shoulders". Do you know how annoying it was to write an if else ladder 
for a case of 5 string values? 

Compare the following, first with the if-else ladder and second with the 
string switch statement:


[[StringSwitchStatements.java]]
[source, java]
----
    ... 

    if(args[0].equals("value1")){
        // do something with value 1
    }else if(args[0].equals("value2")){
        // do something with value 2
    }
    else if(args[0].equals("value3")){
        // do something with value 3
    }
    else if(args[0].equals("value4")){
        // do something with value 4
    }
    else if(args[0].equals("value5")){
        // do some thing with value 5
    }
    else{
        // do some default stuff
    }
    ...

----


[[StringSwitchStatements.java]]
[source, java]
----
    ... 
    switch(args[0]){
        case "value1":{
            // do something with value 1
            break;
        }
        case "value2":{
                // do something with value 1
            break;
        }
        case "value3":{
                // do something with value 1
            break;
        }
        case "value4":{
                // do something with value 1
            break;
        }
        case "value5":{
                // do something with value 1
            break;
        }
        default:{
                // do something with default value
            break;
        }
        
    }
    
    ...
    
----


It is evident that the code becomes easier to read, we do not have to invoke 
the equals method unnecessarily and the block of code becomes neater. Pheew! It is 
advisable to stick with the switch statements. Most IDE's will tell you to do so.


== Type Inference for Generic Instance Creation

In java, a lot of things get us really bogged down, 
all in the name of preserving the object type. One of these monotonous routines 
we do all the time is declaring a generic type - for example a String array list


[[GenericTypeInference.java]]
[source, java]
----
 ArrayList<String> myStringList = new ArrayList<String>();
----

The annoying question we ask ourselves all the time is: 


""
Why the heck do we need to specify generic arguments twice?
""

We may not understand how annoying this is unless we try something a little bit 
more complicated: 


----
Map<String,List<String>> complexMap = 
new HashMap<String,List<String>>();
----


Just imagine, I had to fold my code because I declared a variable - just one 
variable! I swear I must have heard progamming beginners curse java because 
it forced them to type too much. Fortunately, with java 7, the compiler has 
become intelligent enough to know the kind of variable you are creating by
only specifying the first argument type.  A diamond operator is enough for 
the java compiler to make an accurate type inference on the object you are trying 
to create. 


=== Try-with-resources

A try with resources statement is a statement inside a try block that 
declares one or more resources. A resource is an object that must be closed after 
a program is done with it. In the advent of java 7, resources had to be closed 
explicitly in the finally block. A code for handling a simple file read is shown 
below: 

----
Try with resources code
----


The try-with-resources statements tell the compiler to automatically 
close the resource when the block of code has finished executing. No finally block 
is needed again and our code becomes less verbose. See the previous below refactored 
with try-with-resources. Neat huh? 

----
Factored Try with resources code

=== Improved Type Caching for Rethrowing Exceptions from Multiple Catch Blocks

In order to fully understand this feature, let us analyze the code below: 


----
catch code
---- 

In this case, we want to process both fuel and brake exceptions 
the same way and throw them. Before Java 7, if this exception is thrown, 
there is no way for the rethrowException method to indicate that these 
"Exception"s are either fuel or brake. The type is lost in the compiling world. 
However, from Java 7, the java compiler can intuitively deduce that the exception 
object can be either a Fuel or a Brake exception by analyzing your catch clauses. 
The code can now be written as:
